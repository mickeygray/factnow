    believe it is important to protect the privacy of our customers, as well as
    the privacy of visitors to our Site (defined below). We know that you care
    about how your information is collected, updated, used and shared, and we
    want to help you make knowledgeable choices about the information you

    (the “Services”) and to its website located at www.nattaxgroup.com along
    with other sites operated and/or hosted by ANT that relate to properties
    owned or controlled by ANT (collectively and individually, the “Site”). This
    Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites which may be operated

    <ul>
     <li>The types of information ANT collects about you;</li>

     <li> The disclosure of your information to third parties;</li>

     </li>
     <li>
      {" "}
      Other things we think you should know about privacy, information security
      and ANT. The Types of Information ANT Collects About You: ANT only
      collects information from you that is necessary for us to provide Services
      and information that we believe will interest you. We collect the
      following three categories of information from you: (a) Personally
      Identifiable Information; (b) Non-Personal Information; and (c) Passive
      Anonymous Information. All three of these categories are collectively
      referred to as “Information” in this Privacy Policy.
     </li>
     <li>
      {" "}
      Personally Identifiable Information: We may receive and store any
      information that you provide to us or that we learn about you from your
      use of the Site, Services or other sources that would allow us to identify
      you personally. This information is referred to as Personally Identifiable
      Information (“PII”), and shall mean any information relating to an
      identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an
      identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly,
      in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more
      factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic,
      cultural or social identity. For example, you may provide PII to us when
      you enter into an agreement with us, make a customer service request or
      inquiry, or apply for a job with us. As a result of those actions, you
      might supply us with such information as your first and last name, postal
      address, home and/or mobile phone numbers, email address, social security
      number, driver’s license number or identification, insurance coverage
      information, your account number, employment history, information in a job
      application, such as a resume, and any other information that you choose
      to provide that would allow us to identify you personally. We might also
      receive PII about you from third party data sources or marketing partners
      and we may add this PII to the information that we collect about you. In
      most cases, you provide us with your consent to use your personal data in
      accordance with this policy by providing us with that information. In some
      cases, we may specifically ask for your express consent if we believe that
      the information is sensitive or our use of the information may include
      other uses not covered by this Privacy Policy or another privacy notice
      which we have made available to you.{" "}
     </li>
     <li>
      {" "}
      Non-Personal Information: From time to time, we may also ask you to
      provide us with non-personal information, which is data that alone is not
      intended to allow us to identify you personally, such as just your first
      name, birthday, zip code, or demographic information. ANT may aggregate
      and/or anonymize PII so that it becomes non-personal information that is
      not intended to be used to personally identify you. We also automatically
      receive and store certain types of non-personal information whenever you
      visit the Site through the use of “cookies,” which is discussed below.
     </li>
     <li>
      {" "}
      Passive Anonymous Information Gathered Electronically: We, and third
      parties on the Site, may automatically collect certain types of passive,
      anonymous information whenever you use the Site, such as your Internet
      Protocol address, your computer’s operating system, the name of the domain
      you used to access the Internet, the website you came from and the website
      you visit next. This data is used in the aggregate, that is, as a
      statistical measure, and not in a manner that is intended to identify you
      personally. If we collect this information (“Passive Anonymous
      Information”), it will be done passively through the use of certain
      electronic technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs
      (and similar technologies) as explained below.Cookies: We and our
      advertising partners may use “cookies.” When you use the Site, the pages
      you see, along with something called “cookies,” may be downloaded to your
      computer or other device that you use to access the Site. Cookies are text
      files that are stored by your browser on your device or computer. These
      cookies do not contain or collect any PII, but may be used to deliver
      content specific to your interests and for other purposes, such as
      security and administrative functions. For example, cookies are used to
      store your preferences for certain types of information so that you do not
      have to input those preferences every time you use the Site. Most web
      browsers automatically accept cookies, but you usually can change your
      browser to limit or prevent cookies. Cookies in themselves do not
      personally identify the individual user, but rather the computer or device
      that is being used to access the Site. You may have the opportunity to set
      your computer or device to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie
      is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. Different browsers may
      address cookies differently. If you set your browser to not accept
      cookies, it may result in certain personalized services not being provided
      to you when you use the Site from that computer or device.Web beacons,
      Pixels, and Clear GIFs: We and our advertising partners may use web
      beacons, pixels and clear GIFs. These electronic technologies are
      transparent image files that, if used, allow us and our advertising
      partners to track website usage information, such as the number of times a
      given web page has been viewed and whether and when you have opened a HTML
      email, how many times the email was forwarded and which links in the email
      were clicked. Unlike cookies, these technologies are not placed on your
      computer or device. This information helps us to improve our Site and our
      Services and helps our advertising partners by measuring the effectiveness
      of these communications with you. These technologies may be used in
      association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with our
      Site, Services, or advertisements made by our advertising partners.

    </ul>
    <br />
    Disclosure of Information to Third Parties: ANT may give, share, sell, or
    trade your information to third parties under the following circumstances:
    <ul>
     <li>
      {" "}
      Service Providers: We may share your information, including PII, with
      third parties or affiliates with whom we have contracted to perform
      services on our behalf, such as to collect or process payment, do
      something that you have asked us to do, or provide your PII to a customer
      service agent so that they can assist us in fulfilling your request for
      business services and office spaces. Third parties that act on our behalf
      are contractually obligated to keep the PII we provide to them
      confidential and to use the PII we share only to provide the services we
      ask them to perform.{" "}
     </li>
     <li>
      {" "}
      Other Third Parties: We do not disclose your PII to unaffiliated third
      parties who may want to offer you their own products and services unless
      you have requested or authorized us to do so.{" "}
     </li>
     <li>
      {" "}
      Protection of ANT and Others: We may access, monitor, use, or disclose
      your information to do things like (i) comply with the law or respond to
      lawful requests or legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, search

      (ii) protect the rights or property of ANT, our agents, customers or
      others; (iii) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use or to
      mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit; (iv) to respond

      person; and (vi) address, cure or prevent any violations of ANT’s terms of
      use, or (v) as otherwise required by law.
     </li>
     <li>
      {" "}
      Business Transfers: Information may be disclosed as part of or in
      connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or
      transition to another service provider. In the unlikely event of an
      insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, information also may be
      transferred as a business asset. ANT cannot guarantee that ANT’s Privacy
      Policy will remain unchanged in the unlikely circumstance that ANT is sold
      or if it merges with another company.
     </li>
     <li>
      {" "}
      Passive Anonymous and Aggregated Non-Personal Information: You agree that
      we may share with third parties passive, anonymous and non-personal
      information about you. Such information may be aggregated and is not
      intended to allow these third parties to identify you personally. This
      non-personal information is usually obtained through the use of electronic
      technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixels and clear GIFS, as
      described in this Privacy Policy.
     </li>
    </ul>
    Tailored Advertising: The Site may include third party tracking technologies
    that are used by ANT or its advertising partners to try to match
    advertisements to your interests and to deliver these targeted
    advertisements to you when you are using the Site or using other websites
    that are not controlled by ANT. We do not share PII with these third
    parties; however, when you use the Site, we or third parties operating the
    advertisement serving technology may use non-personal and/or Passive
    Anonymous Information that is collected through cookies, web beacons, pixels
    or clear GIFs to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented and to
    perform analytics concerning your use of the Site and other websites tracked
    by these third parties. These technologies also may control the number of
    times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests and
    measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. Logged and/or collected data may
    include IP address, browser identifiers, session information, browser
    cookies, device make and model, carrier provider, carrier user ID, sites
    visited, clicks on advertisements, advertisement(s) served, length of time
    an advertisement was visible, size of the advertisement, and advertisement
    response (if any). Any of this information that is collected and used by ANT
    will be subject to this Privacy Policy and may be disclosed to third parties
    in a manner that is not intended to identify you personally. To the extent
    any of this information is collected by third parties and not by ANT, you
    acknowledge and agree that such collection and use is governed by those
    third parties’ privacy policies and ANT is not responsible for cookies,
    clear GIFs or other electronic technologies in third party advertisements.
    If you wish to prevent ANT from delivering tailored advertisements, you may
    set your browser to not accept cookies. Please note that even if you disable
    the cookie function on your browser or opt-out of third party tailored
    advertisements at the above link, you may still receive advertising when
    using the Site that is not tailored to your interests. Children: ANT does
    not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personal information from
    persons under the age of 18. Children under the age of 18 should not send
    any PII to ANT. If a child under 18 submits PII through any part of the Site
    or otherwise provides such PII to ANT, and we learn that the person
    submitting the PII is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as
    soon as possible. Because we do not knowingly collect any PII from children
    under 18, we do not use or disclose such information to third parties.
    <br />
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    Please see section entitled “Contacting ANT” set forth below, for
    information on contacting us with any request for information collected or
    any personal information deletion request. Upon receipt of your personal
    information request, or your deletion request, we will promptly review and
    handle that issue. This Privacy Policy Applies to U.S. Customers: This
    Privacy Policy applies to customer relationships established in the United
    States. Our Site is hosted in the United States and is intended for United
    States visitors. Parts of this Privacy Policy may not apply to visitors to
    our Site outside the United States because, for example, certain services
    may not be offered to non-U.S. customers. If you are visiting from the
    European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use
    that may differ from U.S. privacy and data protections laws and which may be
    more stringent than those U.S. laws, by visiting our Site and providing us
    with Information, including PII, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer
    to and processing of your PII in the United States. <br />
    Our Security Practices: Our internal data security policies restrict access
    to customers’ PII to authorized employees, agents and subcontractors with a
    “need to know,” and we train such persons on the protection of your PII.
    These persons may use our customers’ PII for ANT’s business purposes only.
    Our employees are bound by our policies to maintain the confidentiality of
    our customers’ PII. Employees who violate their confidentiality obligations
    are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
    <br />
    We maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural
    safeguards that are designed to guard our customers’ PII. For example, for
    the security of your online visit to www.nattaxgroup.com (or any of our
    property-related Sites), we may make use of firewalls, encryption and other
    authentication procedures to attempt to protect your PII from unauthorized
    access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. PII is maintained within a
    server environment that is intended to be secure. Unfortunately, no data
    transmission over the Internet or internal security system can be guaranteed
    to be absolutely secure. As a result, although ANT strives to protect your
    PII, ANT cannot ensure, and does not guarantee or warrant the security of
    our servers nor can we guarantee that information you supply through the ANT
    Site will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet, and
    you acknowledge by your use of the Site that you do so at your own risk. In
    the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your PII, we may
    attempt to notify you as necessary by email or other means so you can take
    appropriate protective steps. By using our Site or providing Information to
    us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding
    security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of our Site
    or your account with us. Unless you indicate otherwise, we may notify you
    using the most current email address you provided to us.
    <br />
    Links to Third Party Sites and Websites Containing ANT Branding: The Site
    may contain links to third party websites. Please be aware, however, that
    ANT is not responsible for and cannot control the privacy policies of these
    other websites or their practices. We encourage you to read the privacy
    policies for these other websites, as they may differ from ours. The Site
    also may contain links to websites that display ANT branding and/or ANT’s
    logo but which are maintained by third parties. Such websites may be
    identified in that they do not display a “nattaxgroup.com” URL. Please read
    the privacy policy on these websites for applicable privacy practices
    relating to Information collected via those websites because they may differ
    from ANT’s privacy practices. This Privacy Policy applies solely to
    Information collected by ANT directly, by phone, online and through our
    customer support services.

    Terms and Conditions: If you choose to visit our ANT Sites, your visit and
    any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of
    Use, including, but not limited to, disclaimers of warranty, limitations of
    liability, and your assumption of the risk of use of this Site.
    <br /> Limitation of Warranty and Disclaimers: In no event shall ANT be
    liable for any damages whatsoever, and in particular ANT shall not be liable
    for special, indirect, consequential, or incidental damages, or damages for
    lost profits, loss of revenue, or loss of use, arising out of or related to
    any ANT Site, or the information contained in it, whether such damages arise
    in contract, negligence, tort, under statute, in equity, at law or
    otherwise. You also understand that ANT cannot and does not guarantee or
    warrant that files available for downloading through the Service will be
    free of infection or viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other code that
    manifest contaminating or destructive properties. You are responsible for
    implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your
    particular requirements for accuracy of data input and output, and for
    maintaining a means external to the Site for the reconstruction of any lost
    data. You assume total responsibility and risk for your use of the Site and
    the Internet. ANT does not make any express or implied warranties,
    representations or endorsements whatsoever (including without limitation
    warranties of title or non-infringement, or the implied warranties of
    merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose) with regard to the
    Site, any merchandise, information or Service provided through the Site or
    on the Internet generally, and ANT shall not be liable for any cost or
    damage arising either directly or indirectly from any such transaction. It
    is solely your responsibility to evaluate the accuracy, completeness and
    usefulness of all opinions, advice, services, merchandise and other
    information provided through the Site or on the Internet generally. Some
    jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above
    exclusion may not apply to you. This section is not intended to constitute a
    waiver, or any limit, of any consumer rights under the CCPA. <br />
    Content and Liability Disclaimer: ANT shall not be responsible for any
    errors or omissions contained at this Site, and does not warrant that
    defects in the Site will be corrected. ANT reserves the right to make
    changes without notice and disclaims any responsibility for providing notice
    of such changes. In addition, ANT has no liability to make changes to
    existing product(s) and /or content. ANT does not warrant that the Site will
    be uninterrupted. Accordingly, all ANT and third party information is
    provided on an “AS IS, AS AVAILABLE” basis without warranties OF ANY KIND.
    In no event will ANT be liable for (1) any incidental, consequential, or
    indirect damages arising out of the use or of inability to use the Site, or
    any information, or transactions provided on the Site or downloaded from the
    Site, even if ANT or its authorized representatives have been advised of the
    possibility of such damages, or (2) any claim attributable to errors,
    omissions, or other inaccuracies in the service and/or materials or
    information downloaded through the Site. Because some states or countries do
    not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or
    incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you. In such
    states or countries, ANT’s liability is limited to the greatest extent
    permitted by law. This section is not intended to constitute a waiver, or
    any limit, of any consumer rights under the CCPA.
    <br /> Indemnification: You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
    ANT, its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers and
    any third party information providers to the Site from and against all
    losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees,
    resulting from any violation of this Agreement or any activity related to
    your submissions to the Site (including negligent or wrongful conduct). This
    section is not intended to constitute a waiver, or any limit, of any
    consumer rights under the CCPA.

    What Else Should I Know About My Privacy? You should be careful to maintain
    the secrecy of your user ids and passwords and/or account information and be
    responsible about protecting your PII and identity, both online and
    off-line. You can refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at
    http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information on how to
    protect yourself from identity theft. <br /> Contacting ANT: If you have any
    questions, comments, or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please email us
    at info@nattaxgroup.com with any request for personal information
    disclosure, or personal information deletion. SEVERABILITY In the event that
    any provision of this Privacy Policy shall, in whole or in part, be
    determined to be invalid, unenforceable or void for any reason, such
    determination shall affect only the portion of such provision determined to
    be invalid, unenforceable or void, and shall not affect in any way the
    remainder of such provision or any other provision of the Policy. ANT’s
    failure to act with respect to a breach by User or others does not waive its
    right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
